When you are dissatisfied with the way things are, with the way you are, it means you are **ready to evolve**, to **take a step forward**.

You can adjust your perspectives. Discover potentials. Resolve painful issues and release the power to change that resides within. You can move toward thinking, feeling and living in ways that add balance and hope instead of pain and hopelessness.

Together we explore your life's circumstances and resulting beliefs that block your progress. We proceed at your pace, working in ways that are best suited to you.

I guide you on this internal journey using techniques such as hypnosis to reveal parts of you that may be holding you back. We may focus on difficult turning points early in life, when misfortune demanded a protective reaction from you. Without proper information, you coped the best that you could. While those skills helped you for a time, they've now produced patterns that no longer serve you; in fact, they may be damaging. It's time to enter the deepest place necessary to**re-educate, correct and heal**those old beliefs.

It may not be easy. It takes courage to bear the truth of your personal story.

But from this truth comes new knowing. Freedom from old, destructive patterns. And the opportunity to be at peace with yourself.
