Life is often confusing and painful.

Your lack of clarity can produce anxiety, depression, insomnia, physical pain and illness.  They become a way of life, impacting the mental, social, physical, sexual and spiritual aspects of your living.

You need **balance at the deepest levels of mind, body and spirit**. You deserve not just psychotherapy, but therapy that creates a well rounded and unique practice for you, combining the best of mindfulness meditation, hypnosis and cutting edge mind/body brain techniques.

Because deep within you lies the wisdom and experience to transform your life. And together we create a secure space to address your pain, and**connect with your hidden strengths**. Whether you choose individual therapy, hypnotherapy, our therapeutic retreats or my meditative hypnosis downloads, I offer you this opportunity to better focus your positive intentions.

If you are ready to make serious changes that will better prepare you for life's challenges, I'm looking forward to working with you.
